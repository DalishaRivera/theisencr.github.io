##Teaching

### 2013-2014: Software Security - Classroom

I was the teaching assistant in the Fall of 2013 and 2014 for the graduate course in software security at NCSU. [Dr. Laurie Williams](http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/index.html) designed and taught the course both semesters, while I designed projects and assignments and graded student work.

### 2014: Software Security - Google Coursebuilder

In the Fall of 2014, I was the Teaching Assistant alongside Dr. Laurie Williams and [Dr. Emerson Murphy Hill](http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/ermurph3/) for a free, open platform MOOC on software security with 400+ students. The course featured lectures from Dr. Williams, technical and design exercises from me, and roundtable discussions on the latest security news every week with all of the instructors. We had a 10% retention rate through the course - quite good for this type of course (typical retention rates are 3-5%).
